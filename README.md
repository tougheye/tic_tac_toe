# tic_tac_toe
My second python project creating a tic-tac-toe game using Tkinter module.

the gameboard.py file creates the grid with the GameBoard class for the game using tkinter
the ext_class.py has 2 classes Player and Game which is an inheritance class of the Game.
main.py starts the game by creating 2 players and starting the game.
